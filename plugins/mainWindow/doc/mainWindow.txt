Functionality that mainWindow Plugin Implments :

The main window plugin is a core plugin that applications can use to create a truly plugin-able application.
MainWindow plugin provides the correct dockable functionality that allows features to be added dynamically
by way of dockItem plugins that would call mainWindow functions.

A mainWindow plugin is actually a dockable feature wrapper around a QMainWindow Object in QT4, we essentially
use the QT4 API for QMainWindow and provide another API layer to the plugin implementer to use.
This layer essentially calls QT4 API - but this API we provide is their to provide dockable/dockItem plugin features
that correctly fit into the plugin theory model that this system is based on.

Thus MainWindow plugin essentially will/can do anything that a 'MainWindow' can do in QT4 initially.
But we can do more with it - esspecially making it reusable - in terms of our API which is a interface for plugins.

Main Window is expected to do :

Main Functioality :

	Menu.
	ToolBar.
	StatusBar.
	CentralWidget.
	WindowFeatures.
	Popup Menus.
