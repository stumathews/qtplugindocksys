	The Dockable/DockItem Plugin System API :
	
	+ Needs QT4 to run :

		The instantiation of serialized objects(plugins) on the filesystem is done using QT4.
		The communication between plugins.

The QT4 library provides a way to take a object and write it to the filesystem.
Then take that object and instantiate it and use it in the application.
This process is called instaniating and serialised object.
A Serialised object is a file that represents a object.
When I say object I mean a C++ instance.
Remember a object is an instance of a class and a instance is what is the result
of initialising a serialized object( a plugin or file ).

So in this respect , we are borrowing QT4's PluginLoader class.
I intend to make my own PluginLoader class sometime, but for now this API seems more usefull to QT4 deveopers.
But in theory if we can develop our own object instanitator we can offer this framework to other developers working on 
other object orientated frameworks...and object is and object no matter where it is...

The signal/slot mechanism is also planning to be used for IPC ( Inter plugin Communication ).
This also will tie us down to QT4.

Again Only with the help of developers out there, will these restrictions be lifted.

But for the mean time project Dockable/DockItem Plugin System API will be restricted to QT4 developers.
