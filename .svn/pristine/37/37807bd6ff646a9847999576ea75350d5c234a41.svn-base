return app.exec();

If Plugin manager gets a Dockable Item -> manage It ( We are top level )
if Plugin Manager gets a dockItem -> find the correct DockableItem and pass it to it for managment.
	if it cant find it -> dockable object not loaded yet -> store in que.

once all plugins are loaded -> traverse through each dockable object and load it.
	-> pass dockable object(parent) to each child(dockItem) and load() each dockItem.
	-> from here each dockItem is indepenant and works with the passed dockable object.


	To find out if a dockItem belongs to a Dockable object :
	-------------------------------------------------------

	Take each dockItem and pass it to each dockableObject's isYourPlugin() function and if
	the dockable object returns false, move on to the next dockable object.
	In the dockable Object the correct casts will check for the right types of plugins suitable for
	that particular dockable object.
