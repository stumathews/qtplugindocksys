How far is the Project ?
-------------------------

YEAR 2006 :
------------

The initial planning is done.
Initial planing implementation is done...almost
The project functions.

The project is not ready for public consumption yet because these things still need to be sorted :

#1 The project now requires some developer's input in terms of implementing it practicaly :
    + How is the best way to produce it to clients ... ?
    + In what ways would we best use it in an application ... ?
    + How will it affect this or that ... ?
#2 We need to figure how to make things more simple but not hide anything
    + Grouped classes ?
    + Trash inheritance dependancy.
    
#3 IPC needs to be implemented
#4 Plugin managment needs to be implemented.

And then letting those developers implement it this those ways...

What needs to be done in the future ?
-------------------------------------

Sugesstions ?
Basically short term goal, get rid of QT4 restrictions.
