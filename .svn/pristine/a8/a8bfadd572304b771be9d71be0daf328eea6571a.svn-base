----------

This is the Initial developer's release of the project.

This release is intended only to lurge potential developers to the project.
And purly as a documentation exercise to see the code.

It is very primative at this point.

This Release is very unlikly to build correctly as it is build as a debug release under QT4.

Apart from this It relies on a specific release of Qt4 at the moment. ( 4.1.1 ).

THIS PROJECT WILL PROBABLY _NOT_ BUILD !
----------------------------------------

Please don't dispear if it doesn't build nice for you - It's not meant to at this early stage.
Look at the code, thats what's important right now.

The screenShot provided was produced by this release - you can _try_ build it though...
